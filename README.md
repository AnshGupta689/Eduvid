**üéì Eduvid: AI-Powered Educational Content Generator**
**üí° About the Project**
Eduvid is a modern full-stack web application designed to accelerate educational content creation. Leveraging Google's Gemini API, the platform instantly generates detailed video scripts, storyboard prompts, and interactive quizzes based on any user-provided topic. It uses a serverless architecture to ensure secure handling of API keys and scalable deployment.

Key Features
AI Script Generation: Generates comprehensive educational video scripts using the Gemini API based on user prompts (e.g., "Explain Ohm's Law").

Quiz Creation: Generates a short, interactive quiz related to the generated video topic, stored via Supabase.

Content Persistence: Saves all generated video scripts and quiz results to a Supabase PostgreSQL database for history and review.

Secure Backend: Uses Netlify Functions to securely handle the sensitive Gemini API key.

Modern Frontend: Built with React and TypeScript using Vite for a fast development experience.

Export to Sheets

üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)
Prerequisites
You must have the following installed locally:

Node.js (v18+)

npm (or yarn/pnpm)

Git

1. Cloning the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/AnshGupta689/Eduvid.git
cd Eduvid
2. Install Dependencies
Bash

npm install
3. Setup Environment Variables
The project requires environment variables for both the client (Vite) and the server (Node.js/Netlify Function).

Create a file named .env in the root directory.

Populate it with your credentials:

Code snippet

# Gemini API Key (Used by the Node.js Server/Function)
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# Supabase Credentials (Used by the Client)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
4. Running the Application
The project uses npm-run-all to start the frontend and backend proxy simultaneously.

Bash

npm run dev-full
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173/, and the Vite proxy will correctly forward API calls to your local backend server.
